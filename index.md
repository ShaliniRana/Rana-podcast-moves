# Invisibilia Podcast Review
**Written by Shalini Rana**
## Invisi--what? 
You are probably asking yourself what this cooky title means or why a podcast would be named such a thing. 'Invisibilia' is the Latin term for "invisible things." Quite literally, Invisibilia, the podcast, explores the invisible forces that shape human nature. Some of these invisible things include, thoughts, beliefs, and emotions. In other words, things in everyday life you may not immediately question. The podcast is currently hosted by Alix Spiegel and Hanna Rosin. **Here's a description of Invisibilia that comes directly from their site:**

*"We weave incredible human stories with fascinating new psychological and brain science, in the hopes that after listening, you will come to see new possibilities for how to think, behave and live.
Invisibilia has explored whether our thoughts are related to our inner wishes, our fears and how they shape our actions, and our need for belonging and how it shapes our identity and fuels our emotions over a lifetime. We investigate ways everyday objects can shape our worldviews, the effects we have on each other's well-being, and the various lenses we don."*

###Episodes
For this review, I listened to two episodes: "Reality" and "Flip the Script". 
Reality examined the way in which humans view the same things differently. For example, the episode often posed the question--how is it that two people looking out the same window can see two different things? While this may seem like a trivial question that every day life doesn't care to answer, it has been relevant to my life! Just a couple of months ago, my roommate and I were shocked to find out that a towel and bowl we used in our kitchen were "green" to me but "blue" to my roommate. We had two totally different perceptions of the same things and we debated on who was right. It's fascinating and truly an exploration of human nature to delve into these kinds of questions. 

"Flip the Script" quite literally explores examples whereby people do the opposite of what their natural instinct is in a situation, in order to, ultimately, transform the situation. Have you ever met someone you hate with complete kindness, even though this person always says nasty things to you? Some great stories are explored in this podcast, such as the police officers in Denmark who are attempting to combat Islamic radicalization with **love**. 

####Organization
The way this podcast is organized seems to vary based on the content the creators gather for each show. Reality was an episode that followed a single story throughout, always tying back to the central theme. However, Flip the Script was composed of a bunch of mini stories that tied back to the theme. The shows were punctuated by small advertisement breaks that somehow flowed back into the story quite well. In both shows, I liked the way in which the host gave a recap after the ad about what happened previously in the story, so listeners who were just tuning in could understand what was going on. Alongside the beginning of the podcast and after the recap, the host does a nice job of introducing the characters of the story, the central theme of the episode, and the setting in which the story takes place. 
####Style/Sound
#####(summary of sound effects heard in both episodes)
- Sound bites of voices and upbeat music overlaying host's narration
    - Not overpowering or distracting
- Christmas-like tune (movie FX)
- Recordings of characters speaking (supplements host's storytelling)
- Muttled background noises (walking inside a house, branches outside, etc.)
- Nature sounds (creek bubbling, crunch of leaves, etc.)
- Overall upbeat and jovial music clips that seem to highlight the positive side of human nature
####Narrative Type
- Story-telling narration

Similar to Serial and S. Town, Invisibilia is very story-like in nature. I enjoyed the balance in the show between the host's narration and the stories and insights shared by the characters of the story. Every sigh, gasp, or stutter of the characters is captured and used to further the tension and excitement of the story for the listeners. I appreciate how the host paces the story in a calm, collected, and intentionally slow manner. This method greatly differs from talkshow podcasts in which multiple hosts are rapidly conversing with each other. Similarly, because of the strategic pauses the host takes while narrating the story, the listeners are able to ponder questions raised in the show, as if we are figuring something out with the characters themselves. Throughout the show, the host repeats or rephrases themes discussed throughout the podcast to keep listeners on track. This is done in a natural way that doesn't seem too forced or annoying. For example, in Reality, the host would often rephrase the previous window question to listeners in order to get them thinking. 

#Overall, I give Invisibilia an 8/10. 
####Thanks for reading my review!
